  <h2 class="left">Left-aligned text</h2>
  <p class="left">This paragraph is left-aligned. Left alignment is the default for most languages.</p>

  <h2 class="center">Centered text</h2>
  <p class="center">This paragraph is centered. It's often used for headings or short pieces of text.</p>

  <h2 class="right">Right-aligned text</h2>
  <p class="right">This paragraph is right-aligned. Right alignment is used in some languages and for specific design purposes.</p>

  <h2 class="justify">Justified text</h2>
  <p class="justify">This paragraph is justified. Justification makes the text evenly spaced between the left and right margins. It's often used in newspapers and books to create a clean, blocky look. It looks best when the lines are relatively long. Here is a very long sentence to show the justify effect, by adding many more words, and words, and words, and even more words.</p>
